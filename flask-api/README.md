# Flask API

This python flask API talks to the PHP Soap service and relays the message to the React FrontEnd app, it's also responsible for handling GitHub webhooks. 

We've implemented a simple SOAP client that lets you talk to the PHP SOAP server. Look at `app.py` for example on how to use it. 

Please reach out to me if you have any questions.

Happy Coding!
